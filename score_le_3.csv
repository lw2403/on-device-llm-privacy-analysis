        return num1
    elif num2 > num1 and num2 > num3:
        return num2
    else:
        return num3
```

This function works by comparing each number with the other two using conditional statements (`if`-`elif`-`else`). If `num1` is greater than both `num2` and `num3`, it returns `num1`. If `num2` is greater than both `num1` and `num3`, it returns `num2`. Otherwise, it returns `num3`.

You can use this function like so:

```python
print(max_of_three(1, 2, 3))  # Outputs: 3

44,Programming and Code Generation,Write a SQL query to find all duplicates in a table.," To find all duplicates in a table using SQL, you can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT column1, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

In this query, replace `column1` with the name of the column you want to check for duplicates, and `table_name` with the name of your table. 

The `GROUP BY` clause groups the rows by the values in `column1`, and the `COUNT(*)` function counts the number of rows in each group. The `HAVING` clause filters the results to only include groups with more than one row, which indicates that there are duplicates in that column.

For example, if you have a table called `employees` with columns `id`, `name`, and `salary`, and you want to find all duplicate names, you can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT name, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM employees
GROUP BY name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

This query will return all duplicate names in the `name` column along with the number of times each name appears in the table.","

This query will return all rows where the values of the specified columns are different from each other.",5,5,5,3,,
45,Programming and Code Generation,Explain the use of lists in Python.," Lists are one of the most commonly used data structures in Python. They are used to store collections of items, where each item can be of any data type. Lists are mutable, which means that their contents can be changed after they are created.

Here are some common uses of lists in Python:

1. Storing multiple values: Lists are often used to store multiple values of the same or different data types. For example, you can create a list of integers, strings, or even other lists.

2. Iterating over elements: Lists can be easily iterated over using a for loop or list comprehension. This makes it easy to perform operations on each element in the list.

3. Sorting and searching: Lists can be sorted using the `sort()` method, and elements can be searched for using the `index()` method or list comprehensions.

4. Manipulating data: Lists can be manipulated using various built-in functions and methods, such as `append()`, `remove()`, `pop()`, and `extend()`. These functions allow you to add, remove, or modify elements in the list.

5. Passing data between functions: Lists are often used to pass data between functions. This allows you to work with large amounts of data without having to pass each element individually.

Overall, lists are a versatile and powerful data structure in Python that can be used for a wide range of tasks.","﻿Lists are a common data structure in Python used to store collections of items. Lists can be created using square brackets `[]` and items can be added to the list using the `append()` method. Lists can also be modified by adding, removing or modifying items at specific indices. Lists are immutable, meaning that once they are created, their contents cannot be changed.",5,5,5,2,,

81,Mathematical Problem Solving,Solve for x in the equation 2x - 3 = 7.,"Sure, here's how you solve that equation:

Given the equation 2x - 3 = 7, the goal is to isolate x.

To do this, first add 3 to both sides of the equation:

2x - 3 + 3 = 7 + 3

This simplifies to:

2x = 10

Now, divide both sides by 2 to get x:

2x / 2 = 10 / 2

This simplifies to:

x = 5

So, the solution to the equation 2x - 3 = 7 is x = 5.","﻿To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation and then simplify.

First, let's add 3 to both sides of the equation:

2x + 3 = 7

Next, we can subtract 3 from both sides:

2x = 4

Now, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 2

Therefore, x = 2.",5,1,5,2,,
82,Mathematical Problem Solving,What is the area of a triangle with a base of 5cm and a height of 3cm?,"To find the area of a triangle, we use the formula:

Area = (1/2) × Base × Height

In this case, the base is 5 cm and the height is 3 cm. So, we can plug these values into the formula:

Area = (1/2) × 5 cm × 3 cm

Area = (1/2) × 15 square centimeters

Area = 7.5 square centimeters

So, the area of the triangle is 7.5 square centimeters.","﻿To find the area of a triangle, we need to multiply its base by its height and then square that result. In this case, the base is 5 cm and the height is 3 cm, so the area is:

Area = (5 cm) x (3 cm) x (1/2) x (1/2) = 5 cm x 3 cm x (1/2) x (1/2) = 15 cm^2

Therefore, the area of a triangle with a base of 5 cm and a height of 3 cm is approximately 15 cm^2.",5,1,5,2,,
83,Mathematical Problem Solving,Calculate the perimeter of a rectangle with lengths 4cm and 6cm.,"To calculate the perimeter of a rectangle, we use the formula:

Perimeter = 2 × (Length + Width)

In this case, the length is 4 cm and the width is 6 cm. So, we can plug these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2 × (4 cm + 6 cm)

Perimeter = 2 × (10 cm)

Perimeter = 20 cm

So, the perimeter of the rectangle is 20 cm.","﻿To find the perimeter of a rectangle, we need to multiply its length by its width and then add those products together. In this case, the length is 4 cm and the width is 6 cm, so the perimeter is:

Perimeter = (4 cm) x (6 cm) + (4 cm) x (6 cm) + (4 cm) x (6 cm) + (4 cm) x (6 cm) + (4 cm) x (6 cm) = 36 cm

Therefore, the perimeter of a rectangle with lengths 4 cm and 6 cm is approximately 36 cm.",5,1,5,2,,
